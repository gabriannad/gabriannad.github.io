				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>For an assignment for the <a href="http://teaching.paulos.net/cs160_FL2014/" target="_blank">user interface class</a> I took at UC Berkeley in the fall of 2014, I designed the user experience and interface for an urban navigation phone/smartwatch app. We were assigned to build this app around the idea of a dérive, which is a concept where “one drifts through a city in an unplanned way subconsciously directed by the surrounding architecture and geography with the ultimate goal of encountering an entirely new and authentic experience.”</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row-container">
				<p>Designing the user flow of the app was relatively easy; since the specs for this project were already fleshed out, I mainly focused on designing the look and feel of the app.</p>
