				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>As a member of Berkeley Innovation, a human-centered design club at UC Berkeley, I’m currently working with three other students on a project with <a href="https://www.vertigo.com/">Vertigo Software</a> (recently acquired by <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/home">MLB</a>). We were essentially assigned to design and prototype <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for designers. A list of Git-equivalent features, including branching and the ability to resolve merge conflicts, were given to us, but the design and function of the application was largely up to us.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row-container">
				<h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
				<p>Ian Birnam, Creative Developer at Vertigo and our main contact, laid out a timeline for our semester-long project. During our first week, he had us do some preliminary research, including competitive analysis and user interviews. <a href="http://www.itsnickki.com/">Nickki</a>, the only one of the four of us who had no experience using Git, took some time to familiarize herself with Git and note any difficulties she had using it for the first time; <a href="http://jihern.com/">Ji-hern</a> did some competitive analysis and identified <a href="https://www.pixelapse.com/">Pixelapse</a> as our main competitor; and Kylon and I conducted user interviews on both designers and users of Git. At the end of the week, we met up and decided on the MVP: a web application that allows designers to work collaboratively on shared files in a design project by being able to track a design file’s history, maintain communication with other designs through comments, and resolve any “merge conflicts" without having to manually edit the file in Illustrator, Sketch, etc.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row-container">
				<h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
				<p>During week two, we jumped right into sketching out an initial design of our web application. Getting started on sketching out an application with so many tasks was pretty daunting, but once we began drawing out our ideas on whiteboard, it was easy for us to lay down some screens without feeling too committed (even sketching with paper and pen can feel too permanent sometimes).</p>

					</div>
				</center>
				<p>Once we had the basic workflow outlined, we divvied up drawing out the sketches with pen and paper to present to Ian.</p>

				<h2>Wireframing with Balsamiq</h2>
				<p>For week three, Ian wanted some higher (but still low) fidelity mockups, so we each drafted up our screen sketches in Balsamiq.  This allowed us to really hash out the workflow of our application as well as discover any holes in the workflow. We also made some new decisions about which features would be included in the product. One of these features was the eqivalent of branches in git, which was one of the features that Ian had wanted us to implement in our application. We decided against including branches in our applcation, concluding that it’s unlikely that designers would need a separate set of <i>all</i> the files, especially if they wanted to experiment on just one file.</p>
			</div>

					</div>
					<div class="cell" style="width: 54%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;">
						<p>Another feature we wrangled with was resolving a merge conflict. (If you’re not familiar with Git, a ‘merge conflict’ is basically a fancy term for when your version of a file and another person’s version conflict because you edited the same parts of the file.) An idea that I suggested was to present the user with a list of attributes of each layer (e.g. position, color, stroke width, etc.) that conflicted between the two versions. The user would then be able to pick and choose the attributes from whichever version they wanted to appear in the resolved file. We decided against this, coming to the conclusion that designers don’t usually work in this manner; they would have to talk to their collaborators to figure out a resolution and then manually fix the conflicts with the design software that they’re using. So we decided to simply show the conflicting versions side by side and allow for comments on the conflict page for designers to sort it out on their own.</p>

				<h2>Higher Fidelity Mockups</h2>
				<p>The feedback we got from Ian on our Balsamiq prototype was generally positive! Our solution for merge conflicts, however, still needed some work. He stressed that having a tool to help designers resolve merge conflicts easily and efficiently without having to open it up in the design program would really make the process less painful for designers. So we resurrected my idea for letting the user pick and choose the attributes of the layers that conflicted between the two versions using our web application. Instead of having the user select individual <i>attributes</i> of a layer, however, we decided that selecting an entire layer (or ‘object’ in Illustrator terms) would be less tedious. So for our next iteration of higher fidelity mockups, we translated our Balsamiq sketches to Illustrator mockups using a simple style guide that Ji-hern drafted up, and I came up with this solution for resolving merge conflicts:</p>

					</div>
					<div class="cell" style="width: 50%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%">
						<p>Upon arriving at the merge conflict page of a file, users are presented with a preview of the current version of the file as well as the proposed, conflicting revision on the right-hand side for a quick comparison of how the two versions differ. On the left-hand side is where the user can reconcile the differences by choosing which version of the conflicting layers they want to be in the most updated version of the file. The user is shown a live preview of what the new version would look like with those chosen versions of the conflicting layers.</p>
